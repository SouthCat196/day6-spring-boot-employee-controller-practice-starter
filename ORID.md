**What did I learn**

1. **RESTful API**: How to correctly design a RESTful API.
2. **Spring Boot**: Spring Boot is a framework based on Spring, designed to simplify the configuration and development process of Spring applications. By using auto-configuration and the principle of convention over configuration, it allows developers to quickly build standalone, production-grade applications.
3. **Difference and Relationship Between Framework and Library**: A library is focused on a specific functionality, simplifying development. Libraries are created to simplify the implementation of certain functions, with the code split into utility classes or functions. To use the functionality, you only need to call the relevant methods. A framework, on the other hand, is focused on the entire development process and simplifies development.

**What I did**

1. To prepare for Thursday's presentation, I organized a meeting to discuss the content and assigned roles for the presentation.

**R:** Happy

**I:**

- Pair development is quite interesting, and it’s very efficient working with Henry.
- The presentation content may still need adjustments. I’m not sure if we’ll be able to cover everything we planned.

**D:**

- The time for the presentation is limited, so we need to think about how to present more valuable content within the available time.
